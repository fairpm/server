# Server

This is the overarching repo for the code deployed to our hosted server, running at https://fair.pm/


## Local Development

see [docs/local_development.md](docs/local_development.md)


## Deployment

Deployment will eventually be automatic, but in the meantime, the infrastructure team needs to deploy the repository via Helm. Ping them when deployment is needed.

To ignore files from deployment, specify them in `.distignore`.
